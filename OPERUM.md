- ( ) CLEAN UP extension and all of the minor utilities (proplists, flexhash, etc.)
  - ( ) Put in better locations
  - ( ) Separate out better
  - ( ) Move and separate tests
  - ( ) Possibly put things in their own gems as necessary- at least mark them as "gemable" for the future
  - ( ) All internal cleanup etc. for stuff as we need
- ( ) Build in some basic profiling (at the ruby vm level) and benchmark tests. Start to see right away where
      bottlenecks are...
