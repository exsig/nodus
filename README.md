_(WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL)_

Framework for [parallel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelization)
[data-flow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow) based applications.

It is influenced by and similar to:

 * [Kahn Process Networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahn_process_networks)
 * [Algorithmic Skeletons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_skeleton) (see also [here](https://github.com/ParaPhrase/skel))
 * [Iteratee IO](http://okmij.org/ftp/Streams.html)
 * And of course the hundreds of other reinventions with names like
   `/(((data|signal|packet)?(stream|flow)|pipe(line)?|(flow|event|signal|reactive)-(processing|programming|architecture|computing|language)/`
   combined with parallelization, concurrency, clustering paradigms, etc. etc...


## Contributing to nodus
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Ensure that it is accompanied with tests.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history etc. If you want to have your own version, or it is
  otherwise necessary, then fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
